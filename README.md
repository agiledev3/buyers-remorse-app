# buyers-remorse-app

A React based web application that encourages better spending and buying habits, to reduce unwanted waste and regret. The application aims to achieve this by creating a scenario where the user is asked to reflect on why they want the item, and to wait a period of time of their choosing before being able to buy. The application also acts as a wish list of desired items.

The running application can be found on [GitHub Pages](https://agiledev3.github.io/buyers-remorse-app)

## Prerequisites:

You will need _node.js_ which is included in most operating systems. You can check your version in the cmd prompt/terminal with _node -v_

Yarn was used with this project and is recommended to continue using. However, npm will work as an alternative with possible conflicts.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation:

run _npm install --global yarn_ in the cmd prompt to install yarn
In the project directory, if it is your first time opening, run _yarn install_ to install all project dependencies. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
