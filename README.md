# buyers-remorse-app

A React based web application that encourages better spending and buying habits, to reduce unwanted waste and regret. The application aims to achieve this by creating a scenario where the user is asked to reflect on why they want the item, and to wait a period of time of their choosing before being able to buy. The application also acts as a wish list of desired items.

The running application can be found on [GitHub Pages](https://agiledev3.github.io/buyers-remorse-app)

## Prerequisites:

You will need _node.js_ which is included in most operating systems. You can check your version in the cmd prompt/terminal with _node -v_
